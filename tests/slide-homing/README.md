# Testing sliding homing

Same as the reflecto homing but using a slider on a screwthread

![setup](ref_homing.jpg)

* 8 time microstepping
* 12v
* 0.2A
* 130g weight

## Results

* spool is black nylon with a 1mm thread

Test shows the homing is accurate to within +- 0.30mm. However, the results are
susceptible to changes in ambient light. With a torch I can produce a 0.5mm
error.
