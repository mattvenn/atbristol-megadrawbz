# Testing reflective homing

This method of homing is interesting to explore because it means our home point can be in the middle of the robot's range rather than at the edges. The edges are harder to get to because if the motors aren't co-ordinated (like at power on) there can be too much tension in the strings.

It's also interesting because if we can sense the string on the spool we have a 1 bit absolute position sensor. This means even if this method can't provide precision homing, it will help move the motors to a safe starting place before a more traditional homing method is used.

* 1600 count encoder with thread wrapped twice
* 8 time microstepping
* 12v
* 0.2A
* 130g weight

## Move Test

First step is checking that moving in and out is reliable.

[Test program](move_test.py) sends moves for 2000 steps, then back 2000 steps.
Read results and write to [errors.pkl](errors.pkl). 

## Results

Test run 50 times.
Maximum error is 1 encoder count.

## Home Test

Test homing by measuring the difference in reflectivity between the string and
the spool

* using [OPB608A](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/photoelectric-sensors/1944018/?searchTerm=194+4018&relevancy-data=636F3D3126696E3D4931384E525353746F636B4E756D6265724D504E266C753D656E266D6D3D6D61746368616C6C26706D3D5E5C647B337D5B5C732D2F255C2E2C5D5C647B332C347D2426706F3D313426736E3D592673743D52535F53544F434B5F4E554D4245522677633D4E4F4E45267573743D3139342034303138267374613D3139343430313826)
* spool is black nylon with a 1mm thread, string is generic brown braid, about 0.8mm

## Results

Test shows the homing is accurate to within +- 1mm.

Shining a light into the opto while it was homing changed the results by 500
steps.
